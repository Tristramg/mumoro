Mumoro: MUltiModal MUltiObjective ROuting

This library aims to provide multimodal routing: combining subway, walking and bike.

It is also multiobjective: it finds the best route optimizing according to time taken,
mode changes, CO2 emissions etc.
If there are two routes, the first being faster but emits more CO2 (100% by car) than
an other route (100% cycling), it will return both routes as none is strictly better than
an other.

The lib folder provides the algorithms
The web folder is an example of web application (can be run as standalone web server)
